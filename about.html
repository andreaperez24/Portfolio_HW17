         <h3> User Research</h3>
         <p>
            I specialize in conducting effective user research that includes industry benchmarking, user interviews, surveys, user testing and data analysis. 
         </p>
         <p>
            I also carry out competitive analysis in order to have a solid idea on where a product stands in the industry and where to take it.

     <div class="skill_item">
        <h3> User Empathy</h3>
        <p>
            Traveling, coming from a different culture and being a teacher made me aware of the differences between people. 
        </p>
        <p>
            By talking and listening to what users have to say in interviews, surveys or user tests  I try to understand the why behind any behavior and how I can act to make a difference in their lives.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill_item">
        <h3> Visual Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
            Through tools like Adobe XD, Figma, InVision and Sketch I am able to portray ideas and solutions based on user’s needs, pain points and frustrations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also enjoy taking part in design challenges by the Adobe XD community to keep my skills sharp and be informed on the latest features.

      <div class="journey_text">
          <p>
            I found my way to design from a successful career in formal education and marketing which gives me a strong background in human psychology, empathy and branding.
          </p>
          <p>
            I stumbled into the world of UX and web design after taking an introductory web design class in 2014 and fell in love with the idea of creating custom web pages to help present ideas to my students and make lessons more engaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visualizing information and making it “eye catching” became my thing when I started my first job as a teacher. Getting student’s attention for 45 minutes or longer was a challenge I succeded at by creating student-centered lessons and understanding the way humans learn and behave.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019 I accepted a position as an associate marketing assistant with a real estate company. Since then, I’ve worked hand in hand with two “Area Top Producer” realtors and another real estate conglomerate group in the Northern Virginia area. In the past year and a half I’ve been able to pick up marketing skills such as: drafting potential client engagement strategies, creating campaigns, drafting promotion material, and personalizing branding for each of my clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, in 2020 I am ready to take on the challenge of applying the skills I’ve learned in my professional career and from the UX UI bootcamp from the GWU School of Professional Studies to make UX design my new full-time career. I believe design drives
            change in the world and has the possibility of making it a better place.
